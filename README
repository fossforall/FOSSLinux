Freedom of Speech Saves Linux
=============================
This is a mirrored fork of the Linux kernel. This fork does not contain a
code of conduct infringing on freedom of speech. Instead it uses a slightly 
modified code of conflict. 

If your pull request is rejected on the basis of a code of conduct violation
feel free to make one for this repository instead. 


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
