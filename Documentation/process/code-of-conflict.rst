Code of Conflict
----------------

The Linux kernel development effort is a very personal process compared
to "traditional" ways of developing software.  Your code and ideas
behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and
criticism.  The review will almost always require improvements to the
code before it can be included in the kernel.  Know that this happens
because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for
the overall success of Linux.  This development process has been proven
to create the most robust operating system kernel ever, and we do not
want to do anything to cause the quality of submission and eventual
result to ever decrease.

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on
the technical issues involved.  We are all humans, and frustrations can
be high on both sides of the process.  Try to keep in mind the immortal
words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other."


It's OK to be Right
-------------------

The point of software development is to, above all, get it 
right.
